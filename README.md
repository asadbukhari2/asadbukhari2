### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a senior full-stack engineer with over 5 years of professional experience delivering scalable, cloud-native web applications for startups, enterprises, and SaaS platforms across industries like **fintech**, **real estate**, **logistics**, and **on-demand services**.

I bring end-to-end ownership — from **initial architecture** and **feature planning**, to **CI/CD deployment**, **monitoring**, and **scaling in production**. I specialize in designing systems that are **performant**, **secure**, and **built to last**.

Whether you're launching an MVP, refactoring legacy infrastructure, or preparing for scale, I’m experienced in every stage of the product lifecycle.
